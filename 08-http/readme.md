# Http exercise

## hello-world
To run the simplest service execute
```
go run ./hello-world/main.go
```

## person rest API
Disclaimer: I know that this API is not rest cause I couldn't get the path parameters so I used the query ones. I'll use some http library to help on this part on the final submission.

To run this API use:

```
go run main.go person.go service.go 
```
